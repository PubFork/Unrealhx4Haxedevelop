Unreal.hx : Haxe for Unreal Engine 4
Code, build, run and package from Haxedevelop/Flashdevelop

IMPORTANT - How to get started:
------------------------------------------------------------

First compilation:

The first time you try to build anything the build will invoke the setup script for you.
This copies and modifies all the needed files and settings that is required to perfome a complete build.
It can take a long time, maybe 5 - 10 minutes or more depending on your computer speed.



Required software to build :
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Visual Studio 2015 	(2017 might work, but is not tested)
- Haxe 3.4.3 / 3.4.4
- Hxcpp 3.4.188 		( Other versions might work, but not tested )
